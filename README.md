## Available Options

- Predators
- Arachnids
- Leeches
- Snakes

## Future Options
I'm going to add sliders to control some values as:

  - Stamina
  - Energy
  - Sanity
- Macroelements
  - carbohydrates
  - fats
  - proteins
  - Water

I'll eventually add something to edit the content of your note book and the content of your backpack but it might take some time.
